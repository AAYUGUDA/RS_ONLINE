# Enhancing Customer Engagement and Revenue Generation for Random Storage Online Retail

## Background: 

Random Storage Online Retail is a thriving e-commerce platform with a global customer base. The company has seen significant growth in its operations over the past three years, with an increase in global revenue, customer registrations, and order placements. However, there is a need to further analyze and understand the data to optimize operations and increase profitability.

## Problem statement: 

Despite the growth, the company’s yearly operations report reveals areas that require improvement. The report shows a disparity in revenue generation across different countries and product descriptions. Additionally, there is a significant percentage of non-registered customers, which could potentially affect customer loyalty and repeat purchases.

## Objective: 

### The aim is to devise strategies that would:

Increase revenue generation across all countries and product descriptions.
Convert non-registered customers to registered ones to enhance customer engagement and loyalty.
Optimize the number of orders placed throughout the year.
The strategies should be data-driven, taking into account the insights derived from the yearly operations report. The ultimate goal is to enhance customer satisfaction while increasing the company’s profitability.
